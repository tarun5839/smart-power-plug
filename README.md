# smart-power-plug
We propose to develop an android application and a prototype using ardunio and some bluetooth sensors. The system is aimed to help people to get an ease. Our system is a standalone system that can be installed with any of the power plug which are installed in our home & A plug-in device that you can attach to your appliances and plug into wall outlets. It allows your phone to act as a remote to turn your appliances on and off.
